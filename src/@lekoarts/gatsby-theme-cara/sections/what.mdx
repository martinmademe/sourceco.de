## What

> We're not an agency, and we're not recruiters.

We don't insist on taking a whole project, and there is no account manager, just you and our Devs. Neither are we looking to place an individual and take commission. We're just a group of experienced developers, who work well together, and slot in seamlessly to fill a skills gap.
