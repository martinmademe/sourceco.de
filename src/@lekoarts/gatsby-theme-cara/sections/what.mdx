## What

> We're not an agency, and we're not recruiters.

We don't insist on taking a whole project, and there is no account manager. Neither are we looking to place a contractor and take commission. It’s just you and our Devs – as and when you need them.

We’re optimised to step in, get you off on the right foot, then step back. 

We’re **not** in it for the long haul.

> Lean, plug-and-play Developer resource as a service.
