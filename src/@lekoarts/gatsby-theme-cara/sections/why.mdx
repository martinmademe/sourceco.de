## Why

> A good Dev these days is hard to find.

The model is broken. You want to build things quickly, and if it's not right, kill it. 

But it's risky, takes time & costs money to find the right resource â€” which makes it almost impossible to scale up (and down) & respond to opportunities.

> A new, agile approach to resourcing.
