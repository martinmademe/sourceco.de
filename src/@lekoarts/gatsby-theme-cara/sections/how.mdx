## How

> We like to keep things simple. So, we only have two operating models. **Fixed** or **Fluid**. 

We supply a Principal Developer, then step back.

We want it to feel like just another product build. No friction and no lag. Utilise our Principal Dev like you would an in-house Senior Developer. 

They will help scope the work, define features, suggest an appropriate tech-stack and estimate the effort. We provide the extra resource and our Principal Dev look's after them.
